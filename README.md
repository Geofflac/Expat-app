# NUS FINTECH SG - PROJECT
This project has been developed during the NUS FINTECH program. It was a great use case to apply theoretical knowledge and class exercises seen in class and develop a unique full-stack application.
This project was a team effort, besides the Dev-Ops part.<br />
 <br />
In a few lines, our project was to develop an application for expats around the world. When arriving in a new country, expats have usually a set of doubts about their finances, such as how to access some services, which financial institution is the best, etc ... We wanted to provide a one-stop platform for those questions to be answered through product comparison, forum, a news feed, etc...

## 1 - Design Challenge
The first part of the course looked at how to generate ideas for a potential application using tools likes a design thinking, persona, journey map, survey, collaborative online murals (https://app.mural.co/t/nusfintechlab5100/m/nusfintechlab5100/1622022096022/44417910d4a2f8e271bbf7b44396ef2e3c7fa7c2?sender=d43fd46c-f937-4794-bb8c-ada899f0e72e), etc... and support those ideas by using a value proposition, lean canvas, cost/revenue, etc...
We managed to develop a first clickable mock-up of the application (https://mockittapp.wondershare.com/app/d128852cc6e80101df0275ad9383720c4cc3259d?simulator_type=device&sticky#screen=sksa0k7vqx018rn) and collect first users feedback to update this first mock-up.

## 2 - Front-end / Back-end / APIs
For this part of the course, we developed our front end (HTML - CSS - JS), our Back-End (NodeJS, Express, MySQL), and connected our application to APIs, such as OCBC bank API to collect product information.<br />

We used tools such as POSTMAN to test our APIs and Back-End response.<br />

We also implemented an authentication service to our app with AUTH0.<br />

GITHUB was used as a collaborative tool and stored our code.

## 3 - Dev-Ops
At this stage of the course, each team member had to provide their own Dev-Ops project, mainly involving, deployment, containers, sprints, CI/CD, GITHUB actions, etc,...

## 4 - Smart contracts
For the last part of the course, we were introduced to smart contracts on the Ethereum network by generating ERC20 tokens. SOLIDITY language was used to create the smart contract. We created a METAMASK wallet to store those tokens. Our back-end is connected to the user METAMASK wallet and displays the wallet address.<br />
